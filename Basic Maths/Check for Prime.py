# Given an array arr[] of size n of non-negative integers. 
# Each array element represents the maximum length of the jumps that can be made forward from that element.
# This means if arr[i] = x, then we can jump any distance y such that y â‰¤ x.
# Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array starting from the first element.
# If an element is 0, then you cannot move through that element.
# Note:  Return -1 if you can't reach the end of the array.
